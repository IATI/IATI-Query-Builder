About
-----

A simple form that will build a query string that can then be used to fetch data from the IATI Datastore API.


Requirements
============
A webserver running php and php-curl

Installation
============

Place all the files on your server and visit index.php to deploy.

Helpers
-------
The /helpers directory has a script `refresh_group_data.example.php` that you should modify for your needs.
Running this script will generate a .json file of groups in use on the IATI registry, and this in turn will populate the group drop down of the form.

You could set this up as a cron job on your server.
