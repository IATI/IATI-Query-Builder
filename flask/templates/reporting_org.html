<p class="explaination-text"><strong>WARNING:</strong> The Datastore contains activities reported by both primary and secondary sources. A secondary source, such as the UNOCHA Financial Tracking Service (FTS), reports data it holds about other agenciesâ€™ activities. An agency may well report activities to both IATI and FTS, who in turn reports the same activities to IATI.</p>
